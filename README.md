# R Projects 📊

A collection of my R projects exploring data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.  
Here is a set of self-contained projects with scripts, datasets (if small), and outputs.

## 🔍 Contents
- **Data Analysis** – Exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and reporting  
- **Machine Learning** – Implementations of algorithms (e.g., random forest, neural nets, SVMs, regression)  
- **Visualization** – dashboards, interactive charts, and data storytelling  
- **Utilities** – Reusable functions and helper scripts
